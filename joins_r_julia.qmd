We name "units" comparaable entities that will be compared through matching.
We name "strata" a combination of covariates such as categorical covariates have the same value (eg. country and biome) and continuous variable have se thame binned values (eg. elevation, slope or initial forest cover).
We create a dataframe of treatment with 1 unit belonging to a first strata (eg. Brazilian areas of low and flat initially dense tropocal moist forest), 2 units of a second strata (eg. Brazilian areas of low and flat initially sparse tropical moist forest)

```{julia}
import Pkg; Pkg.add("DataFrames")
using DataFrames

treatments = DataFrame(
    id1 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"],
    strata = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
)
print(series1)
``` 

```{julia}
controls = DataFrame(
    id2 = ["g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n"],
    strata = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
)
print(series2)
``` 

```{julia}
matching = join(treatments, controls, on = :strata, kind = :inner) 
print(matching)
```
